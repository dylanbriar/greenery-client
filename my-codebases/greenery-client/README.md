Money doesn't grow on trees, but maybe it can grow with them. 

Our bank accounts are like trees, and every paycheck we feed them is packed with nutrients to help it grow. But what happens if we want different trees for different fruit?

On Budgetree, split your bank account into several different accounts, without ever touching your real money. Decide on a percentage or flat amount, set it aside from each paycheck, and watch that account grow! Each of these "trees" can be for things like gifts, subscription services, rent, exciting things to save up for, or whatever else you can imagine! Simply add a new account, specify how much money to take from each paycheck, and subtract any money that comes from that tree!

Get planting!
